<a name="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<p>
This User Guide will aid you in understanding how this Scoring System works and how it should be used.
Since the system is quite large and has many sections to describe, you may find it useful to consult
the <a href="#contents">Contents</a> page or the <a href="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a> section
if you have a specific query.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, this first part of the User Guide will cover the general basics of the system, which should
provide some useful background on common terms and how the system represents sporting competitions.
</p>

<a name="intro-setup"><h3>How the system is set up</h3></a>
<p>
The system is web-based, meaning it requires a web-browser to use it. While this means that the system
could be run over the internet, it does not have to be - indeed, for private school use, it can be run
over a local server to be accessed by a limited number of computers, or indeed can be run on a single
computer, requiring no internet connection to run. Note that while this Guide will explain how to set
the system up on a server, the choice of server setup itself is up to the person in charge of running
the system.
</p>
<p>
The system consists of two main parts: the system itself, which handles all of the processing and user
interaction, and the database, which contains all of the system's data and is accessed by the main system
in order to display information.
</p>

<a name="intro-access"><h3>Accessing the system</h3></a>
<p>
Access to the system is controlled by User Accounts, so that only authorised persons may use the system.
These Accounts are organised into User Groups, which store access permissions to the system. Access
permissions define what sections of the site a User in that Group is allowed and not allowed to use, which
prevents Users from accessing important administration tools in the system that they should not be allowed
to use.
</p>
<p>
Users who are not logged in are only able to access the logging in page. Users who are logged in can all
access the system's default landing page and the help files, however all other pages are controlled by
permissions. Each single sidebar link is controlled by a permission flag; these are: 'Admin Panel',
'Manage Days', 'Edit Scores', 'View Scores' and 'Analyse Statistics'.
</p>

<a name="intro-represent"><h3>How the system represents sporting competitions</h3></a>
<p>
This system is designed to be able to support a wide variety of sporting competitions, rather than being
limited to a pre-defined selection. However, in order for the system to be able to handle the task of
scoring a competition, that competition must conform to the following standard, which is how the system
represents competitions as data:
</p>
<p>
A Competition is an overall sporting engagement in which there are several Teams, each with their own
unique group of Competitors. These Competitors may also (optionally) be classified into Subgroups (each
Competitor may only have one Subgroup), which are used for certain data analysis and organisational tasks.
In the context of an in-school sporting event, Teams represent Houses and Subgroups represent Year Groups.
</p>
<p>
Then, there are many Events which make up the Competition. Each Event only occurs once, and is entered by
a set number of Competitors from each Team (this number is fixed for an individual Event - however different
Events may have different numbers; additionally, an Event can be limited to be only open to certain Subgroups).
Since many Events may be scored in a similar way, the Competition also has a set of Scoring Schemes, which
define how many points each finishing position is worth, and what the units and value order of results are.
Each Event can use a single Scoring Scheme.
</p>
<p>
A Competition also has a soft limit on how many Events an individual Competitor may enter ('soft' meaning
that infractions are warned about, but are not prevented from happening). It is possible to mark certain Events
as not counting towards this limit. Finally, there is a set of Records (one for each Event) stating what the
current Record to beat is for that Event.
</p>
<p>
That is a general idea of what a Competition must be in order to be scored using this system. So long as a
real-world sporting competition can be adapted to fit those rules, it is valid for scoring by this system.
On a more specific level, the representation of Competitions is split into two halves: Competition Templates
and Days.
</p>
<p>
As its name suggests, a Competition Template contains all of the settings that define a Competition that
may be repeated on many separate occasions (such as annual competitions like Sports Day or the Swimming
Gala). Once a Competition Template has been defined, Days can be derived from it. A Day is a specific instance
of a Template - for instance, there might be a Sports Day Template, but Sports Day 2012 or Sports Day 2013
would each be an individual Day. The Day stores data unique to itself, such as Team Lists. An important
feature is that changing a Competition Template does not retroactively alter existing Days - Days are
essentially 'copies' of their Template at the time of creation; after that point, any changes to the
Template will only apply to future Days. This allows the layout of a Competition to be changed (such as
adding Events) without invalidating existing data. For this reason, once a Day has been created, its structure
(total numbers of Teams, Subgroups, Scoring Schemes and Events, and how they interact with oneanother) cannot
be modified without deleting the Day, modifying the Template, then recreating the Day. It is possible to rename
certain aspects of a Day defined in the Template, however, as these do not affect the structure of the data.
The system can be scoring only one Day at a time - this is set in the Competition Management section of the
program, and is reflecting in the scoring and results parts of the system.
</p>

<a name="intro-developcompo"><h3>How to work out if a Competition is supported by the system</h3></a>
<p>
It may be difficult at first to work out if a sporting competition can be represented by the system,
given the above description. This section will explain how to convert a real world competition into a
form that the system can recognise - simply follow these instructions (note that if you cannot represent
your competition by using these steps, then your competition probably cannot be represented by the system
- sorry!).
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Step 1: Decide Teams</dt>
<dd>
First, make a list of all the Teams taking part in the Competition. Teams are collections of Competitors,
taking their scores from their Competitors, and it is for the Teams that the final rankings are decided.
There must be at least one Team per Competition (you can have only one Team if for some reason you cannot
/ do not want to split up a single body of competitors, but this system is most useful for Competitions
with multiple Teams). Typically, a Team might be a House or a visiting school.
</dd>
<dt>Step 2: Decide Subgroups</dt>
<dd>
Now, make a list of all the Subgroups in the Competition. Every Competitor, regardless of Team, must be
classed into a single Subgroup. The job of Subgroups is twofold: they make it possible to produce a high
score for each Subgroup, and Events can be set to be only available to certain Subgroups. There must be
at least one Subgroup per Competition - if you do not want any Subgroups, simply create a single Subgroup
(called 'All' or something similar) and assign all Competitors to that. Typically, a Subgroup might be a
Year Group.
</dd>
<dt>Step 3: Decide Events</dt>
<dd>
You should now create a list of every Event that takes place during the Competition. Should there be an
Event that is run multiple times for different Subgroups, that Event should be listed once for every
Subgroup that enters it - for instance, on Sports Day you might have a Year 7 High Jump, a Year 8 High
Jump, etc... Each of these would be a separate Event. The Competition must have at least one Event.
</dd>
<dt>Step 4: Decide Scoring Schemes</dt>
<dd>
Finally, take your list of Events and group them into similar sets. All of the Events in a set should
have the same number of Competitors entered by each Team, have the same types of results, which are
taken in the same units and ordered in the same direction (i.e. first place should always be either
the highest or the lowest value for the whole set, but not both). Additionally, the number of points
that each finishing position is worth should be consistent across the set. Once you have made these
sets, record each one as a Scoring Scheme, detailing the shared features of the scoring method behind
each Event.
</dt>
</dl>
<p>
If you can represent your Competition in this way, then it can be managed using this system!
</p>
 
<a name="install"><h2>Installing the System</h2></a>
<p>
Before the system can be used, it must first be installed. This part of the User Guide covers how to
set up the system for the first time.
</p>

<a name="install-serverreq"><h3>Server Requirements</h3></a>
<p>
The system must be installed on a web-server, although it is not required for this to be connected to
the internet, as the system may be accessed over a local network or from the server itself. However,
the server should have the latest version of PHP and MySQL, and preferably some sort of GUI-based
management system for the database (however, if you are proficient in writing SQL queries, this will
not be essential).
</p>
<p>
Any server that fits this description will do, however we recommend XAMPP
(<a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html</a>)
as a good choice of server package. XAMPP is a free, convenient tool for installing and managing a PHP
web-server and MySQL database system, as well as other server tools. It can be run from any computer
rather than a dedicated server, and a portable version (i.e. version that runs from a memory stick) is
available. If you lack experience with running a server, do not want to get external internet hosting,
or just want a simple server setup, then XAMPP is the way to go. However, it is not compulsory to run
the system.
</p>
<p>
Once you have your server set up and configured (as per its instructions), you can install the system
on it.
</p>

<a name="install-db"><h3>Installing the Database</h3></a>
<p>
The system is comprised of two sections: the program files and the database. Before we install the main
system, we shall first set up the database so it is ready for the system to use. Open your database
management software (if you are using XAMPP, or possibly some other hosting package, this will likely
be phpmyadmin, however other solutions or even the SQL console will work) and Import the file '<i>setup.sql</i>'
which is provided with this system. This setup file will create the entire database, its tables, user,
and basic data in a single action. If this succeeds with no errors then you may proceed to the next step.
If a problem is encountered, make sure your server is correctly set up and try again. If it still fails,
use the <a href="#contact">contact details</a> at the end of this Guide to request technical support.
</p>

<a name="install-files"><h3>Installing the Program Files</h3></a>
<p>
With the database fully set up, the program files can now be installed. Create a folder in the server
where you want the system to be accessed from - you may wish to consult your server's manual for
possible locations. Then copy the entire contents of the '<i>scoresystem</i>' folder provided into this
location on the server. The system should now be set up! To check it works, open your browser and enter
the address of your server and the location you installed it at. You should be presented with the log
in page of the system.
</p>
<p>
If for some reason you do not see this page, make sure your server is configured correctly and try again,
or use the <a href="#contact">contact details</a> at the end of this Guide to request technical support.
</p>

<a name="install-start"><h3>Getting Started</h3></a>
<p>
Although the next section of this Guide covers how to actually use the system, it is worth noting that
the system comes with a default User Account and User Group set up. The username of this account is
'<i>root</i>' and the password is '<i>root</i>' (this can be changed). This account belongs to the User
Group '<i>Administrator</i>', which had permission to do anything on the system. Use this account to log
in for the first time, and to create further User Accounts and User Groups.
</p>

<a name="maintain"><h2>Maintaining the System</h2></a>
<p>
While most normal operation of the system can be handled through the system itself once it has been
installed, there are a handful of tasks that can only be done by a technical user behind the scenes.
Such tasks are discussed now.
</p>

<a name="maintain-backup"><h3>Backing up the database</h3></a>
<p>
To ensure that data is not lost permanently in the event of some accident or mishap, it is important
to take regular backups of the database. Then, in the event that the original data is lost of corrupted,
the backup can be restored and the data retrieved.
</p>
<p>
Taking and restoring backups is made incredibly easy with database software such as phpmyadmin (which
comes with many web-server systems, including XAMPP). To back up the database, open your database
management software and chose to export the system's database. This will produce an SQL dump. Save this
file to wherever you want to keep your backup. It is important when creating the SQL dump that you make
sure that all settings are set to produce a full copy of the database, not just one part of it.
</p>
<p>
To restore the backup, drop any existing versions of the tables and content in the system's database.
Depending on the level of detail recorded in the backup SQL dump, it may be neccessary to drop the actual
database as well - note that if you do this, you may need to recreate the SQL user to go with the database
(SQL code for this can be found in setup.sql). You can then import the SQL dump. This will rebuild the
entire database exactly how it was when the backup was taken.
</p>

<a name="maintain-adminfix"><h3>Fixing deleted administrator users</h3></a>
<p>
While the system comes with an administrator account set up by default for you to start using the system,
it is not impossible that you could accidentally delete or lose access to the only account with administrator
access on the system, effectively locking yourself out. If you do this, it is possible to create a new
User Account and User Group by directly inserting them into the database.
</p>
<p>
First, look in the '<i>usergroups</i>' table for an administrator User Group entry. This should have the
field '<i>perm_admin</i>' set to 1. If you can find one, note down the value of the '<i>ug_id</i>' field.
If you cannot find one, then insert a new row into the '<i>usergroups</i>' table, setting the following
values: '<i>name</i>' = '<i>Administrator</i>' (or whatever you want to call the new User Group) and
'<i>perm_admin</i>' = <i>1</i>, or edit an existing User Group to have '<i>perm_admin</i>' equal to <i>1</i>.
The values of the other '<i>perm_...</i>' fields do not matter, but since this is an administrative
User Group you may wish to set them all to <i>1</i>. If you had to create a new User Group, take note of its
'<i>ug_id</i>' field.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, if your User Account still exists in the '<i>users</i>' table, change its '<i>ug_id</i>' field
to the value you noted down. If the User does not exist, then create a new row in '<i>users</i>' with the
following values: '<i>name</i>' = '<i>New User</i>' (or whatever you want to call the new User),
'<i>password</i>' = <i>SHA1('password')</i> (this will give the User the password 'password') and
'<i>ug_id</i>' = the noted value of '<i>ug_id</i>'.
</p>
<p>
This process will create a new administrator User Account.
</p>
 
<a name="use"><h2>Using the System</h2></a>
<p>
With the system set up and ready to use, we shall now cover how each part of the system works and how
they should be used. These are best used as guidance while using a panel - if you require instructions
on carrying out a particular, broad task, then see the next section.
</p>

<a name="use-login"><h3>Logging In and Out</h3></a>
<p>
If you are not logged in and try to access the system, you will be prompted to log in. Simply enter
your username and password to gain access to the system.
</p>
<p>
When you are finished, click 'Log Out', which is located in the lower box on the left menu bar.
</p>

<a name="use-accountsettings"><h3>Account Settings</h3></a>
<p>
Here you can see your name and User Group, and change your password. To change your password, enter
your old password and a new password (the two cannot be the same), and confirm the new password.
This change will take immediate effect.
</p>

<a name="use-welcome"><h3>Landing Page</h3></a>
<p>
This is the default page of the system. If there are any warnings the system has generated about the
currently active Day, these will be displayed here.
</p>

<a name="use-admin"><h3>Admin Panel</h3></a>
<p>
This panel acts as a hub for the management of the system as a whole. From here you can manage User
Groups, User Accounts, and the system logs.
</p>
<p>
To create a new User Group or Account, enter a name to call it by and click the 'Create' button.
This will create the item and take you to a Settings panel to fill in its details.
</p>
<p>
To modify an existing User Group or Account, select it from the drop-down list and click the 'Edit'
button. This will take you to the same Settings panel as used when creating an item.
</p>
<p>
To delete an existing User Group or Account, select it from the drop-down list and click the 'Delete'
button. This will require confirmation, as once performed it <i>cannot</i> be undone.
</p>
<p>
To access the system logs, click the link provided.
</p>

<a name="use-groupsettings"><h3>User Group Settings</h3></a>
<p>
This panel allows you to modify the settings of a User Group that already exists or has just been created.
There are two parts: the name of the User Group and its permissions. Permissions are granted if the
checkbox next to them is ticked, or are withheld otherwise. Once you have made the necessary changes,
click the 'Save Changes' button to save your modifications. Leaving this page without saving will cancel
any unsaved changes.
</p>
<p>
<i>Caution: Ensure there is at least one User Group with Administrator permissions at all times, to ensure
all of the system is always accessible without needing to directly modify the database! Do not change
your User Group to one without Administrator permissions or you will lose access to the Admin Panel!</i>
</p>

<a name="use-deletegroup"><h3>Delete User Group</h3></a>
<p>
This panel requests confirmation that you wish to delete the User Group you selected on the Admin Panel.
Select 'yes' to permanently delete the User Group, or 'no' to return to the Admin Panel. You cannot delete
a User Group if any Users still belong to it. If they do, assign them to a different User Group first.
</p>

<a name="use-usersettings"><h3>User Settings</h3></a>
<p>
This panel allows you to modify the settings of a User Account that already exists or has just been created.
There are two distinct sections to this panel: the basic settings of the User and their password.
</p>
<p>
The basic settings part consists of the User's name and the User Group to which they are assigned.
Changing the User Group will change the system access permissions for this User. Once you have made
the necessary changes, click the 'Save Changes' button to save your modifications. Leaving this page
without saving will cancel any unsaved changes.
</p>
<p>
The password part allows you to change the User's password. Enter a new password and confirm it, then
click the 'Change Password' button to set the new password. Leaving this page without saving will
cancel any unsaved changes.
</p>
<p>
Note that changing the details in one form section, then saving the other section, will not save the
settings in the first section. Each must be edited and submitted separately.
</p>
<p>
<i>Caution: If editing yourself, <b>do not</b> change your User Group to one lacking Administrator permissions,
or you will lose your Admin Panel access!</i>
</p>

<a name="use-deleteuser"><h3>Delete User</h3></a>
<p>
This panel requests confirmation that you wish to delete the User you selected on the Admin Panel.
Select 'yes' to permanently delete the User, or 'no' to return to the Admin Panel.
</p>
<p>
<i>Caution: Do not delete yourself!</i>
</p>

<a name="use-logs"><h3>System Logs</h3></a>
<p>
This panel shows all action logs taken by the system. A log entry is recorded every time any User performs
an action with an effect on the database or system as a whole. It is useful for tracing actions performed
to identify where a problem may have occurred.
</p>
<p>
Log entries are displayed in chronological order. Each page displays 20 log entries at most. Use the bar
along the bottom to select a page number to skip to.
</p>

<a name="use-compmanage"><h3>Competition Management Panel</h3></a>
<p>
This panel acts as a hub for setting up Competition Templates and Days, changing the active Day, and
managing Records.
</p>
<p>
To create a new Competition Template or Day, enter a name to call it by and click the 'Create' button.
For creating a new Day, you will also have to specify a Competition Template to derive the Day from
- make sure that the Template is fully correct before doing so, as you cannot amend the structure of the
Day once it has been derived. This will create the item and take you to a Settings panel to fill in
its details.
</p>
<p>
To modify an existing Competition Template or Day, select it from the drop-down list and click the
'Edit' button. This will take you to the same Settings panel as used when creating an item.
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to change non-structural aspects of a Day that were copied from the Competition
Template used to make it, namely the names and some output parameters of Teams, Subgroups, Scoring
Schemes and Events. To do this, select a Day to adjust from the drop-down list and click the 'Adjust'
button. This will take you to a panel with a similar layout to the Competition Template Settings panel,
however, only certain non-structural fields can be changed.
</p>
<p>
To delete an existing Competition Template or Day, select it from the drop-down list and click the
'Delete' button. This will require confirmation, as once performed it cannot be undone.
</p>
<p>
To change the currently active Day, select an existing Day from the drop-down list and click the
'Set as Active Day' button. The change will be reflected in the system's title bar on the page load
after the change has been processed.
</p>
<p>
To manage the base Records for a Day, select that Day from the drop-down list and click the 'Manage
Records' button. This will take you to a panel where the base Record data can be viewed and modified.
</p>

<a name="use-templatesettings"><h3>Competition Template Settings</h3></a>
<p>
This panel allows you to modify the settings of a Competition Template that already exists or has just
been created. Note that changing the content of a Competition Template will only affect Days derived
from it <i>after</i> these changes have been made, and will not retroactively change existing Days derived
from this Template. It is not compulsory to keep Templates for Days once the Days are made, but it is
useful for repeating Competitions, such as annual tournaments, as the Template can be reused.
</p>
<p>
This panel has five sections to fill in. The earlier sections have an effect on the later sections,
so <i>it is strongly recommended that you fill in the sections in the order they are given</i> on the page.
Any changes to a section which resize or redefine the layout of a later section will cause data currently
stored there to be lost. Therefore, it is useful to plan out exactly what the Competition Template will
look like before entering it into the system. Consult the section
'<a href="#intro-developcompo">How to work out if a Competition is supported by the system</a>' in this
Guide for help with this.
</p>
<p>
First, enter the basic details. These are the name of the Template and the maximum number of Events a
single Competitor may take part in (note that if a Competitor goes over this limit during a Day, it is
warned about on the Landing Page, but the system will not attempt to prevent it). These values do not
affect the rest of the form, so can be changed at any time.
</p>
<p>
Next, enter the list of Teams taking part in this Competition. To add a new Team, click the 'Add New Team'
button and enter the Team's name in the text box. To remove a team, click the 'Remove' button next to it.
The name of any existing Team can be edited through its text box at any time - it is not necessary to remove
it and re-add it. The number of Teams affects the number of Score elements in the Scoring Schemes section
later, so try to avoid needing to change the number of Teams once you get that far (renaming them is alright).
</p>
<p>
Now enter the list of Subgroups for this Competition. Adding, editing and removing Subgroups works in
exactly the same way as for Teams. The entire Subgroups list affects the options in the Events section
later, so try to avoid needing to change the names of or number of Subgroups once you get that far.
</p>
<p>
The next step is to add Scoring Schemes. Each Scoring Scheme consists of seven components: the name, the
number of Competitors entered per Team (into an Event using this Scheme), whether first place should be
awarded to the highest or lowest value results, the type of measurement taken for these results (such as
Distance or Time), the units these measurements are taken in (such as metres or seconds), the minimum number
of decimal places to which values in these units should always be represented, and finally the Scores
themselves. The number of Score boxes depends on the number of Teams already entered, and the number of
Competitors entered per Team for this Scoring Scheme. Therefore, try to avoid changing either of these
values once you start entering Scores, or you will have to re-enter them. Adding, editing and removing a
Scheme works in the same way as before. The Scoring Scheme itself affects part of the Events section later,
so try to avoid changing the names of or numbers of any Scoring Schemes once you start adding Events.
</p>
<p>
The finally section to enter data for is the Events section. Each Event has four settings, each requiring
a short explanation. The name of the Event is simply its name - that is not complicated. The number of
Competitors entering per Team is also fairly straightforward; however its value affects which Scoring
Schemes may be selected for this Event. Only Scoring Schemes with the same number of Competitors per Team
as this Event may be selected for it. These are the third setting, which are a simple drop-down list of
all the existing Scoring Schemes, of which you must select one for this Event. Finally, there is a
multiple-selection box of all the existing Subgroups. These are the Subgroups that are eligible to take
part in this Event. This may be one or many Subgroups. To select many Subgroups, hold down the Control
(Ctrl) key while selecting each Subgroup.
</p>
<p>
Once all the data has been entered, click the 'Save Changes' button. The entire Template will be saved
into the database, and be ready to have Days derived from it.
</p>

<a name="use-deletetemplate"><h3>Delete Competition Template</h3></a>
<p>
This panel requests confirmation that you wish to delete the Competition Template you selected on the
Competition Management panel. Select 'yes' to permanently delete the Template, or 'no' to return to
the Competition Management panel. Unless a Template was created by mistake, it is generally not advisable
to delete Templates - they do not take up a large amount of space, and tend to contain valuable data
that you may wish to reuse.
</p>

<a name="use-daysettings"><h3>Day Settings</h3></a>
<p>
This panel allows you to modify the settings of a Day that already exists or has just been created.
When a Day is created, it fully copies all of the settings of the Template it is derived from - however,
to ensure data consistency, none of these values can be modified from this panel (but it is possible to
make non-structural changes from the 'adjustment' panel). The Day settings that can be modified are the
name of the Day, the year it takes place in, whether it should import Records from a previous Day, and
the Competitors taking part in the Day.
</p>
<p>
Setting the Day name and the Day year is simple - just edit the text boxes, noting that the year <i>must</i>
be a number. The 'Import Records' option requires more explaining. Records set for a Competition are stored
with the Day, <i>not</i> with the Competition Template. This is because the Competition Template could
change, and there is no guarantee we will want to carry over Records to newly created Days (for instance,
if we add old Days into the system in non-chronological order). However, the system recognises that often
we <i>will</i> want to carry over existing Record data, hence the existence of this feature. When first
creating a Day, select the previous Day you wish to copy Records from. When you click 'Save Changes' after
filling in the rest of the form, the Records as of the end of that Day will be set as the base Records to
beat for this new Day. <i>Note: This only needs to be done once per Day, or if the Records for the previous
Day are changed after an import. Selecting the 'Do not import Records' option will not cause Records
to be blanked - they will simply not be overwritten when the settings are saved.</i>
</p>
<p>
Adding Competitors to the Day is optimised for adding large numbers of Competitors at once. However,
they must be first subdivided two ways: firstly by Team, and secondly by Subgroup. The Day Settings
form has a text entry area for each combination of Teams and Subgroups, sorted first by Team and then
by Subgroup. Either type each name in to the appropriate text entry area, or paste the list in if it
already exists. Each name should be separated by a new line.
</p>
<p>
A Competitor will typically be a person, but this does not always have to be the case. At its core,
a Competitor is a single entity taking part in Events - therefore, it could also be several athletes
working together, such as in a Relay Team; in cases such as this, the Relay Team itself is the Competitor.
</p>
<p>
When you have entered all of the Competitors into each text entry box, click the 'Add Competitors'
button for that box. This will automatically separate the Competitor name dump into individual
Competitors, each with their own row. To delete a Competitor, click the 'Remove' button next to their
name. To edit a Competitor, simply edit their name in their text box. <i>Remember to click 'Add
Competitors' before saving the Day! Any Competitors not allocated to their own text field, so remaining
in the data-entry box, will be discarded when the Day is saved!</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Important Note: You are free to add more Competitors during the scoring process of a Day. You are also
free to rename them, however to do this, <b>always</b> rename the existing Competitor - <b>never</b>
remove and re-add them, as the system will count them as two different Competitors. If a Competitor
already has Scores associated with them, the system will not detect that the Competitor is missing until
their Score is overwritten by rescoring that Event. Until this occurs, some data for the affected Event
may not display properly.</i>
</p>
<p>
Once all Competitors and other settings have been set, click the 'Save Changes' button. This will save
the Day to the database.
</p>

<a name="use-adjustday"><h3>Adjust Day Components</h3></a>
<p>
This panel allows you to rename or change a select few attributes of a Day that it derived from its
Competition Template that do not affect the overall structure of the Day. The Day structure cannot be
modified without deleting the Day, modifying the Competition Template, then recreating the Day, in order
to preserve the integrity of already entered data.
</p>
<p>
The layout of this panel is very similar to the Competition Template Settings panel, however certain fields
(those that affect structure) are read-only and cannot be modified. The remaining fields can be easily
changed to modify how the Day data is presented.
</p>
<p>
You are free to change any of the modifiable values, however, <i>if you change the result ordering or score
values of any Scoring Scheme, you will need to resave all scoresheets for Events using that Scoring Scheme
via the Edit Scores panel</i>, or the old scoring rules will remain applied to those Events. Changes to any
other fields do not require further adjustment from other panels.
</p>

<a name="use-deleteday"><h3>Delete Day</h3></a>
<p>
This panel requests confirmation that you wish to delete the Day you selected on the Competition
Management panel. Select 'yes' to permanently delete the Day, or 'no' to return to the Competition
Management panel. If you delete the currently active Day, you will need to select a new active Day
before you can do any more scoring with the system. Unless a Day was created by mistake, it is generally
not advisable to delete Days - they do not take up a large amount of space, and tend to contain large
amounts of valuable data.
</p>

<a name="use-managerecords"><h3>Manage Records</h3></a>
<p>
This panel allows you to view and modify the base Records of a Day that already exists. Note that these
are the <i>base</i> Records - they are the Records to beat for this Day, but they do not contain any Records
set on this Day. The purpose of this panel is to allow you to make any modifications or tweaks to any
Records that require correcting. While you can by extension view base Records here, it is recommended
to use the Analyse Records panel for that task.
</p>
<p>
To change the currently loaded Record, select its Event from the drop-down list. The form will
automatically update with all of the Record's data. If you wish to modify this data, edit it then click
the 'Save Changes' button.
</p>

<a name="use-scoreentry"><h3>Score Entry</h3></a>
<p>
This panel acts as a hub for scoring Events in the currently active Day. The summary box at the top of
the panel lists how many Events have been scored correctly, scored incorrectly (i.e. in an inconsistent
/ contradictory way), and not yet scored at all. A full breakdown of all Events, their colour-coded
status and a summary of their results is then listed in the table below. To score an Event, select it
in this table - this will take you to an Edit Scores panel where you can enter the score data.
</p>

<a name="use-editscore"><h3>Edit Event Scores</h3></a>
<p>
This panel allows you to score an Event in the currently active Day that you have selected from the
Score Entry hub panel. At the top of the form is a message informing you of the currently scoring status
of this Event. The rest of the form is dedicated to the data entry itself.
</p>
<p>
Each Team is listed in the form, and for each Team there are as many scoring rows as there were 'Entrants
per Team' specified in the Competition Template that this Day was derived from. You will probably
receive the scores you are to enter on a score card of some description. Simply copy the data into
this form. The available Competitors to assign a score to will be limited to those in Subgroups that
are eligible for this Event. If a Competitor is missing from the list, then select the 'Missing From List'
option as the Competitor. A sub-form will appear under this data row, into which you should enter the
name of the new Competitor and the Subgroup they should belong to. If your Event (like most typical Events)
is only open to a single Subgroup, then that will be the only available Subgroup. If it is open to many,
then you will have to select one. Upon submission of the form, any missing Competitors will be added to
the appropriate Competitor list. This will happen regardless of whether or not the data submission was
successful (i.e. regardless of whether you made any mistakes, unless those mistakes were with the missing
Competitor's new details), so if you submit a scoresheet that has problems, you should see your new Competitor
in the drop-down list. It is also possible for a User with the appropriate permissions to add missing
Competitors directly into the Day Settings panel, however this can be cumbersome. That panel will be
required should you get the new Competitor's details wrong, however.
</p>
<p>
Once you have entered the score data for this Event, check it carefully, then click the 'Save Changes'
button. This will save the Score to the database. If the system agrees that your score data makes sense,
it will mark the scores as 'consistent' which will display in green. While this does not guarantee that
your scores are error free, it means any obvious errors will have been detected. However, if any of
your score data is contradictory, such as the Competitor in second place having a better result than the
person in first place, then the system will mark these scores as 'inconsistent' which will display in red.
If this occurs, you should carefully check the data you have entered and correct any mistakes. You may
edit score data already inputted as many times as you want, even if it was marked as consistent the
first time.
</p>

<a name="use-liveresults"><h3>Live Results</h3></a>
<p>
This panel allows you to view the results for the currently active Day presented in a variety of formats.
This data updates live - this means that if a User inputs a new set of scores from another computer into
the system, they will appear on this results panel automatically!
</p>
<p>
The panel fetches new data from the server at a fixed time interval. By default this is 5 seconds, but
you can change this by changing the value in the control panel box at the top of the page. If you want
to stop the panel from automatically updating, set this value to 0 seconds. You may trigger a one-off
update by clicking the 'Manual Update' button.
</p>
<p>
There are four information panes and a progress bar in this panel. The progress bar shows the number
of Events correctly scored so far out of how many Events there are in total. The remaining four
information panes show the current overall scores for each Team, a list of any and all broken Records,
a list of the highest scoring Competitors in each Subgroup, and a full breakdown of all results for all
Events. Each of these information panes can be minimised by clicking on its title bar, and re-shown by
clicking again. In the Event Scores pane, clicking an Event's name will toggle the visibility of a full
breakdown of the Scores for that Event.
</p>

<a name="use-stats"><h3>Statistical Analysis</h3></a>
<p>
This panel acts a hub through which six statistical analysers can be accessed. Each of these panels
will produce a data table of a different sort based on a combination of sources selected. Each of
these panels works in a similar way, so all six will be detailed at once here.
</p>
<p>
The six panels available are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyse Days - compares overall statistics about each of the selected Days.</li>
<li>Analyse Events - compares results and records for each of the selected Events.</li>
<li>Analyse Teams - compares results, records and scores for each of the selected Teams.</li>
<li>Analyse Competitors - compares results and records for each of the selected Competitors.</li>
<li>Analyse Records - produces a table of all records for each of the selected Days, as at the end of
those days; any newly set records are highlighted.</li>
<li>Produce Scoresheet - produces a summary table of results from a single selected Day, intended for
distribution to interested parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In each panel, you can select which items you want to compare. You may compare as many or as few items
as you want, and there does not have to be any relation between them such as being on the same Day.
This allows you to compare the same Competitor across multiple Days, or to track a Team's progress over
time. For any lists of Events, the rows are automatically cross-referenced so that different Days with
the same (named) Events can be easily compared. Once you have selected what you want to compare, you
can click the 'Generate Table' button to produce the analysis table.
</p>
<p>
The Produce Scoresheet panel has some unique options available to it, which affect how much information is
displayed in the output. Most of these are self-explanatory, however note that the checkboxes for displaying
only Events open to certain Subgroups will show any Event into which <i>at least one</i> of the selected
Subgroups may enter, so if an Event is open to all Subgroups, selecting any one of those boxes will have
that Event appear. Note also that these options do not affect what data is collected in the summary table
- that data will always cover the entire Day.
</p>
<p>
As well as generating a results table within the system, this panel can also generate the same table
as a Word document or Excel spreadsheet. These files can be downloaded; however it is recommended that
you resave the files after downloading them due to technical constraints in how they are produced.
</p>

<a name="use-help"><h3>Getting Help</h3></a>
<p>
Help with using the system is available in two forms while actually using the system. Firstly, inline
help messages are displayed on all panels where necessary to guide you while using them. This includes
both success and error messages that display when an action is taken to help inform you on what to do
next. However, if these are not helpful, a second form of online help is available, and that is...
this User Guide! A copy of this User Guide can be accessed from the 'Help' link in the menu. You may
even be reading it now! Additionally, every panel has a link to its section of this Guide in the top
right corner of the page.
</p>
 
<a name="faq"><h2>Quick Starters, Frequently Asked Questions, Troubleshooting and Other Miscellany</h2></a>
<p>
The following points deal with common questions and problems, including common tasks that it may not
be immediately clear how best to perform. If you have a question that is not answered here or anywhere
else in this Guide, please get in contact using the details at the end of this Guide to request technical
support.
</p>

<a name="faq-browsers"><h3>What web-browsers is the system supported on?</h3></a>
<p>
This system will work in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox (and should work in any standards compliant
browser). <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> is recommended, as it is the browser
the system was primarily built and tested on. The system can also run on iPad!
</p>

<a name="faq-adminfail"><h3>Help! I have lost access to / accidentally deleted all of the User Accounts with administrator access on the system!</h3></a>
<p>
Should you lose access to your administrator account(s), follow the instructions given in the
'<a href="#maintain-adminfix">Fixing deleted administrator users</a>' section of this Guide.
</p>

<a name="faq-access"><h3>Help! I cannot access part of the system!</h3></a>
<p>
Access to each part of the system is controlled by permissions set to the User Group to which your
account belongs. If you are an administrator, you can change these privileges yourself; otherwise,
ask your administrator if you think you should have access to a section you cannot see. Additionally,
note that sections of the website that require an Active Day to be set (such as Score Entry and Live
Results) will be inaccessible if an Active Day is not set. The Active Day can be set in the Competition
Management Panel.
</p>

<a name="faq-prepare"><h3>How do I set up the system before a competition starts?</h3></a>
<p>
Before a (real-world) competition starts, you will need to set up the system to handle it. The procedure
for this is relatively straight forward.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
	If a Competition Template already exists for this competition, check all of its settings are valid and
	up-to-date by selecting to edit it in the Competition Management Panel. Should a Template not already
	exist, create it via the Competition Management Panel. See the
	'<a href="#use-compmanage">Competition Management Panel</a>' section of this Guide for more information.
</li>
<li>
	Once you have a Competition Template prepared, create a new Day in the Competition Management Panel,
	using the Competition Template as its base template.
</li>
<li>
	Enter the name of the Day, the year it is taking place in, and, if this Day is one in a series of Days
	based on similar Templates and you want Records from a previous Day to carry over to this one, select
	that previous Day to Import Records from. Finally, add all of the Competitors who could be taking part
	in this Day. See the '<a href="#use-daysettings">Day Settings</a>' section of this Guide for more
	information.
</li>
<li>
	Once you have saved your new Day, set it as the currently active Day from the Competition Management
	Panel. You are now ready to go!
</li>
</ol>

<a name="faq-score"><h3>How do I score Events?</h3></a>
<p>
To score Events on the currently active Day, go to the Score Entry section of the system and select an
Event to score. Events that have been scored are highlighted green, except those containing an error
which are highlighted red, and are ignored by the system for scoring purposes.
</p>

<a name="faq-results"><h3>How do I find out what the current Scores are / what Records have been broken / who has won the 'Victor Ludorum'?</h3></a>
<p>
All information about the currently active Day is available on the Live Results panel, which updates
live as new information is entered into the system. 'Victor Ludorum' winners are listed as the 'Current
Highest Individual Scores' on this panel.
</p>

<a name="faq-records"><h3>How do I get a list of all the current Records for a competition?</h3></a>
<p>
The Records for a Day can be accessed from the Analyse Days panel (accessed through Statistical Analysis).
If you have used the 'Import Records' feature when creating the Day, then it should list all previous
Records, as well as the newly broken ones. Records broken on this Day will be highlighted.
</p>

<a name="faq-sharing"><h3>How do I share data from the system after a competition, such as if a staff member wants access?</h3></a>
<p>
Depending on your needs, there are several ways of giving people access to data collected by the system.
</p>
<p>
If simple statistics are all that are needed, then you could simply generate a datasheet using one of panels
in the '<a href="#use-stats">Analyse Statistics</a>' section. Follow the link for help on using that section.
</p>
<p>
If you need to actually share access to the system, for instance so that scores can be verified by the
person in charge of the competition, then you have two options. If the server is running from a laptop
or other portable device, you could simply make the device available to the person who wants access.
Alternatively, you could place a copy of the system on a publicly accessible webserver - this will also
be the option you want to choose if you want to share the system with multiple people.
</p>
<p>
To place a copy of the system on a web server, first install a fresh copy of the system onto your web server
by following the <a href="#install">Installation Instructions</a>. Then take an SQL dump from the original system,
by following the <a href="#maintain-backup">Backup Procedure</a>. However, instead of restoring the backup to the
original system, restore it to the new server. You will now have a duplicate system set up. Note that these two
systems will be distinct - changes on what will not be automatically reflected on the other. To transfer changes
made on one system to another, simply back up the most recent system and restore it to the other one.
</p>
 
<a name="contact"><h2>Contact Details</h2></a>
<p>
If you have a question or problem that is not answered by this Guide, then you can contact the creator
of the system at the following email address:<br>
