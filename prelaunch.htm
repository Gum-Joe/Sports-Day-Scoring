Hello, and again, welcome to the Computer Aided Scoring System.
The startup routine has been processed, and we are now ready to begin the scoring proper.
Before we start however, please bear in mind that although fun (and learning) are the primary
goals of scoring activities, serious injuries may occur. For your own safety, and the safety
of others, please ensure:<br>
<ul>
<li>You have disabled all proxy settings on client laptops / devices.</li>
<li>This laptop is correctly broadcasting its network.</li>
<li>Client devices are using a compatible browser.
<ul>
<li>Recommened: Google Chrome</li>
<li>Will work: Mozilla Firefox, other standards-compliant browsers</li>
<li>Does not (always work): Microsoft Internet Explorer</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<br><br>
When you have done everything on the checklist, click
<a href="index.php">here</a> to open the scoring system.
<br><br>
Good luck!<br>
